# Password-Generator-Project
## Description
  - Developed a user-friendly application to generate secure, randomized passwords based on user-defi ned criteria (length, numbers, special characters). Utilized Python and Tkinter for the GUI, using randomization logic to select letters, numbers, and special characters for robust security. Enhanced user experience with real-time feedback on generated passwords and implemented input validation for error handling.
